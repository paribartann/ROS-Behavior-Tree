# ROS-Behavior-Tree


This program has implemented a domain-independent Behavior Tree model in a ROS Environment, and executes a tree for a dummy environment for trial purpose.
The dummy environment is presented below:

![Decanonicalized BT](./images/BT.png)

Details can be found in: http://orca.st.usm.edu/~banerjee/papers/IROS18.pdf

To Run:

1. git clone this repository
2. cd path/to/the/folder
3. catkin_make
4. source ./devel/setup.bash
5. rosrun bt_package tree_node _param:=src/bt_package/files/BT_Fig8
6. If it complains about rosmaster, then in a new terminal do: roscore



(Have to give the address to the BT text relative to your position as a parameter)


Note:
You can use this as a framework by providing a new file that represents a BT structure and the corresponding implementation of its environment.
